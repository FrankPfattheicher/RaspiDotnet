Install the debugger for linux-arm (target computer)

Install the native dependencies of .NET Core. 
On Raspbian, this should only mean installing Curl and unzip if it they aren't already installed (sudo apt-get install curl).

Run the following command on linux-arm (installs to ~/vsdbg):
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/getvsdbgsh | bash /dev/stdin -r linux-arm -v latest -l ~/vsdbg
